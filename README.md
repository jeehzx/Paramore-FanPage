Welcome to the unofficial website of the band **Paramore!** This project was created as part of a **practical case** for my **Web Development course** at **MasterD Portugal**, with the goal of sharing information about the band, their discography, and their history.

## Project Description

This website was developed using only HTML and CSS. It consists of several sections, each dedicated to a different aspect of the band Paramore:

- **Home**: An introduction to the band with a brief description.
- **Discography**: Albums released by the band.
- **Learn More About the Band**: Information about the band to help you get to know them better.
- **Contact**: A fictitious section where you can send a message to the band and see their contact information.

## Technologies Used
